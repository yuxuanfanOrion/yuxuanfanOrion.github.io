## ✋🏻 Welcome to Yuxuan FAN'S homepage

🧑‍🎓 I'm currently a seond year M.Phil student at [AI Thrust, Information Hub](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/),  I received my bachelor degree of [School of Advanced Engineering, USTB](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/) in 2024. I also had a chance to study Economy in [National School of Development, Peking University](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn/).

📢 I am passionate about contributing to large-scale, impactful open-source projects.

💼 Now I am a Research Intern at [Inclusion AI](https://github.com/inclusionAI), Ant Group, focusing on enhancing the visual reasoning ability of Ming-Flash-Omni model.

# ✨ Hobbies
I believe the meaning of life lies in experiencing a wealth of things, and in always being on the journey.

I am a big fan of Chelsea and Oklahoma city thunder.

I am also a starry sky and astronomy enthusiast, and I love looking up at the stars at night. I’m really into science fiction.
